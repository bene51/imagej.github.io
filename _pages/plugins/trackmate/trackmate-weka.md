# TrackMate-Weka.

This page describes a detector module for [TrackMate](/plugins/trackmate/index) that relies on the [Trainable Weka Segmentation](/plugins/tws/index) plugin to segment objects in 2D or 3D. It is not included in the core of TrackMate and must be installed via its own [update site](/update-sites/following).

## Installation.

For this module to work, you just need to install the TrackMate module. Subscribe to the  **TrackMate-Weka** update site.
